Last week, I conducted a hangout on air on behalf of Revealing Hour Creations. The title was "A look at Bluetooth Low Energy".  
The motive was to introduce everyone to the technology and some of it's most sought out applications. It was more of a 101 for BLE than anything else.

Here's the YouTube link to the Hangout on Air

The topics that were covered in the webinar were  

1. History of BLE  
Where did the tech evolve, the people involved and the timeline
2. The advantages and pitfalls of BLE
3. Architecture of BLE  
What does one mean by profiles, services, characteristics, values, descriptors 
4. Beacons  
What are the Apple iBeacons, their packet format, some startups and the use cases that they are pursuing using iBeacons
5. Smartphones  
iOS and Android support for Bluetooth Low Energy, software as well as hardware
6. [Chip manufacturers for BLE](http://slides.com/anujdeshpande/ble/#/7)
A comprehensive list of some of the major chip vendors and their offerings.
This is especially useful for someone looking to use BLE in a new product idea.
6. Tah
A look at Tah, which is Revealing Hour Creations development board for building amazing things using Bluetooth Low Energy.
7. Bluetooth 4.1 and 4.2  
What's new in the updates that have been pushed to the 4.0 standard

Since this was a webinar, we had people listening in and asking questions about the content and anything else related to BLE. I answered some questions during the presentation. Most of them were answered towards the end, after the presentation.

The webinar was scheduled on 24th January 2015, 9pm IST. We conducted it out of our office premises in Pune and it was a nice experience. Quite different from presenting at a conference, but a welcome change.
