### Introduction
The breath is the source of Prana for the human body. It consists of five elements - Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Space, as illustrated in the figure below.

Ayurvedic medical practice acknowledges three doshas in the human body - Pitta, Kapha and Vata and three nadis - Ida, Pingala and Sushumna. While breathing, the nostrils operate alternatively, meaning, there are times during the day when only the left nostril (Ida nadi) is actively breathing, times when only the right nostril (Pingala) is actively breathing and times when both (Sushumna nadi) breathe in unison. As per the science of Ayurveda, 6 am to 10 am Kapha is dominant, 10 am to 2 pm Pitta is dominant, and 2 pm to 6 pm Vata is dominant. Accordingly, the breath switches nostrils too.

 
### The Five Elements
Each of the five element, viz., Earth Fire, Water, Air and Earth are associated with a particular state of mind.
 
##### Earth
During inhalation and exhalation, if the breath touches the base of the central bridge of the nose, it is said to be the **Earth** element.
The Earth element is associated with groundedness and stability.

##### Fire
If the breath touches the tip of the nostrils, its is said to be the **Fire** element.
The Fire element is associated with knowledge, wisdom and deep concentration, but also with being judgemental  or critical. 

##### Water
If the breath passes through the right or left base points of the nostrils, it is said to be the **water** element.
The Water element is associated with an emotional, nervous or anxious state of mind.

##### Air
If the breath brushes the right or left nostril wall of the nose, it is said to be the **Air** element.
The Air element is associated with a shaky, hyper state of mind.

##### Space or Ether
If the breath passes very subtly through the centre of the nostrils, it is said to be the **Space** element.  
The Space element is associated with an ungrounded by free state of mind.

### Putting it together
