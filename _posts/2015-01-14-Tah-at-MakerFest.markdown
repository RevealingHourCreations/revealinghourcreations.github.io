This year's Maker Fest was organized at **CEPT University in Ahemadabad, Gujrat** on **10-11th January 2015.**. Revealing Hour Creations was invited to conduct a workshop on the **Tah board** for students, innovators, creators, entrepreneurs and makers coming from all over India. We arrived on the 10th Jan by Duronto Express thoroughly enjoying the journey from Pune to Ahmedabad. This was the first time we were visiting Ahmedabad and we loved it.

You can check out the scheduled [talks and workshops](http://www.makerfest.com/workshops/) at Maker Fest. 
The workshop was conducted at the Fab Lab in CEPT University. Once [@Dhiraj Jadhao](https://www.twitter.com/dhirajjadhao) and I ([@Vikas Gaikwad](https://www.twitter.com/vksgaikwad3)) got started with the workshop, the lab was over-crowded with makers and students, and we had to stop the registrations! Perhaps Tah is more famous than we realize.

We found during the workshop makers, students, innovators are very eager to know more about Tah board. The workshop was very interactive, people were enjoying the workshop and asking questions about Tah, the software support, about FCC and other certifications,what are the design changes etc.

There was a lot of anticipation amongst the crowd for the launch of the Android SDK.

We showed some intresting demos based on Tah and smartphone communication to control anything around you.Tah is the building block for IoT(Internet of Things).The mood lamp, motion controlled computer, controlling a light bulb and smartphone controlled robot are the things that people liked the most. After we got done with the workshop we got some amazing feedback from the makers.

There were a number of interesting workshops that were arranged around IoT, Bluetooth Low Energy, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, NFC, home made PCB making techniques, augmented reality and gaming simulators. A lot of innovators had made their own 3D printers and CNC Milling Machines.

We had an amazing time interacting with people at the University. A lot of the makers were intrested in Desktop 3D printing and had created their own 3D printers.

I found some interesting projects based on augmented reality and gesture control. With **Puppetry** you can control the puppets by using your finger movements with the help of a camera; it was quite enjoyable. I also enjoyed Google 3D Card based game simulator, it felt like you were actually a part of the gaming world.

During the event we visited stalls of some startups as well, which were presenting their products on this occasion. These included Home Automation based products, Pollution Monitoring Systems, GSM and GPS based tracking systems to name a few.

One of the teams there had designed and developed a 'Smart Pollution Monitoring System' which could be connected to the cloud to send and log data related to pollution (sound, air).

After the event, it was time for a food safari in Ahmedabad. We had some Kachchi DabeliÂ and Gujrati Vadapav and as expected, it was sweet! We also had a Wood Fired Pizza which was awesome.

We bought some Halwasan to take home and left Ahemdabad on 11th Jan and returns to Pune.

We had a nice and engaging day at Ahmedabad.
