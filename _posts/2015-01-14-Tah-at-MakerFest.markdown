We had a workshop at Fab Lab in CEPT university since before workshop we thought very few people will come to attend but once me([@Vikas Gaikwad](https://www.twitter.com/vksgaikwad3)) and [@Dhiraj Jadhao](https://www.twitter.com/dhirajjadhao) started with Tah workshop, the Fab Lab was completely filled with makers and students, The situations comes we need to stop the registrations for the workshop got a unexpected count of peoples for workshop. Now we realised the Tah is becoming famous in Makers.


We found during the talk in workshop makers, students, inovators are very eager to know more about Tah board. The workshop was very interactive like peoples were enjoying the workshop and asking the questions about Tah and software supports of Tah and questions related to FCC and other certifications,what are the design changes etc.

Getting feedback from Makers about android SDK launch. They were eagrly wating for Tah Android apps to launch.

Here is the list of events that took placed at [Maker Fest](http://www.makerfest.com/workshops/)


We had a great time in CEPT university interacting with people. We found that maximum makers had created 3D printers. Most of the makers were intrested in Desktop 3D printing.

I found some interesting projects done based on Agumented Reality and Gesture control **Puppetry** you can control the puppets by using your finger movements with the help of a camera; it was quite enjoyable. I also enjoyed Google 3D Card based game simulator, it felt like you are actually a part of the gaming world.

During this event we visited some stalls of some Startups. They were presenting their products on this occasion. This was a great platform provided for Startups to get visibility. Startups were working on Home Automation based product, pollution monitoring system, GSM and GPS based tracking systems based products development companies.

One of the team had designed and developed a Smart Pollution monitoring system which can be connected to the cloud to send and log all the data related to pollution like sound, air and data logging over the network.

Now its time to have a food safari in Ahemadabad. We had a Kachhi Dabeli and Gujrati Vadapav, as expected it was a sweet vadapav. Also we had a Wood Fired Pizza that was awesome.

Have brought a Gujrati Sweets Halwasan famous sweet of Ahemdabad. Left Ahemdabad on 11th Jan 2015 and returns to Pune by Duronto Express.
